# Straight Ahead Coaching
This is a project created for a client wellness and coaching program. The application registers interest for the program, then directs the user to a payment page where they can buy the program. They are then sent an email and their information is stored for later use. Currently still in production

# How It's Made:
Tech used: React, TailwindCSS, Node, Express, React-Paypal-js, MongoDB, Nodemailer

My learning was focused on creating a react application that loads dynamically and reactively. 

# Optimizations
The interface is fairly simple - the client did not request anything more. Other projects could be more customized and styled.  
Media queries can be upgraded, and the mobile version is optimized, but in-between screen sizes need work. 

# Lessons Learned:
How to create global react components that update consistently. 
Paypal and other payment integration
